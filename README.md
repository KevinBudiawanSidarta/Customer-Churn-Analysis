### Overview
This churn analysis dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of customer behavior for NetraTel in 2024, focusing on identifying patterns and potential drivers of customer churn. It provides key visualizations for business stakeholders to understand retention risks and customer segmentation.

### What the Dashboard Shows
1. Overall Churn Rate:
  - The churn rate is 26.5%, meaning over a quarter of customers have left the service.
2. Customer Demographics:
  - Gender: Customers are nearly evenly split between male (49.52%) and female (50.48%), with no major churn differences.
  - Partner Status: 51.7% of customers have a partner, but this doesn’t show a strong impact on churn directly.
3. Contract Type and Churn:
  - Most customers are on month-to-month contracts (55%), which typically show higher churn compared to yearly contracts.
  - Insight: Month-to-month contracts correlate with higher churn, indicating the importance of encouraging long-term commitments.
4. Payment Methods:
  - The majority use electronic checks and bank transfers, which are associated with higher churn.
  - Insight: Certain payment methods may reflect customer trust or tech-savviness and affect loyalty.
5. Tenure Status
  - Customers are segmented into Very Loyal, Loyal, and High Churn Risk.
  - 31.79% fall under “High Churn Risk,” indicating a significant segment at risk of leaving.
6. Churn by Senior Citizen Status:
  - Senior citizens have a significantly higher churn rate compared to non-seniors.
  - Insight: This segment may require tailored support or retention strategies.
7. Tenure Groups and Churn Rate:
  - Customers with shorter tenure (0–6 months) show higher churn rates.
  - Longer-tenured customers (49–72 months) are more loyal.
  - Insight: New customers are more likely to churn, suggesting a need for improved onboarding or early retention efforts.
8. Monthly Charges and Churn Rate:
  - Churn rate increases with higher monthly charges, peaking in the “High” group.
  - Customers with very high monthly charges have the lowest churn rate, this indicates that customers in the 'very high' segment may receive facilities/services that are very satisfying, resulting in a low churn rate. 
  - Insight: Customers with higher bills may feel dissatisfied or overcharged, suggesting a need for value-based pricing or better communication of benefits.
